        <p>
            My name is <strong><em>bhuvaneshwar and my nick name is don</strong></em>, usually my friends call me like that,... 
            there is a truth that , I dont have friends but i have classmates, who i can call them as friends.
            I am here to xplain what the friendship i mean.
            the friendship is that a person i need, who should support me, call me, help me instead of teasing, 
            teasing not a prob becoz it is commmon in now a days.
            But always teasing is a problem right.
            If my friend is doing anythiung he can call me anytime instead of using me when they r in need of myy help.
        </p>
        <p>
            So i am saying, having no friends is also a prob becoz i use to get so many pains but i cant able to share it, only
            few things only i can able to share that is to becoiz if they reveal it also, nothing will happen to me.
            Becoz i have crossed like that with many fake friends telling to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            god gave me everything except friendship, some use to say i am ur friend but friend is like a father,mother,brother,
            neoghbour, helper, motivator, secret keeper, everyting in this universe.
            that i can able to trust him blindly and if any pain comes i can share so that, i can get some relief.
            My friendship is like one way communication that is, i will only call, chat,etc.... but from my friend nothung wil.
        </p>
        <p>
            a real special thx to html, so that i can share it to u. 
            And i will be waiting to get my friend whom i should not call him as friend. the person should be close friend to me.
